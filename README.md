# Focus u dipshit

Focus u dipshit is a small project to help people do their actual work in quarantine. If you have difficulties focusing on your work, this is probably going to solve it.

_also, you're not a dipshit_

# Installing

Installing focus u dipshit is kind of easy. You will need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), and maybe [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for convenience, but it's not required. If you don't have Node already, you will have to download it. So, go to a folder on your computer and do:

```
git clone https://github.com/werymanen/focusudipshit
```

##### or if you don't have git installed, hit the clone button on GitHub and put it in a folder called "focusudipshit"

Now, you will have focus u dipshit downloaded. Go to the folder "focusudipshit" and do:

```
npm i
```

It will install the dependencies, and now to run, you will have to do:

```
node index.js
```

## Now, it should work.

If it doesn't, or you have an idea to improve the program, please leave it in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/werymanen/focusudipshit/issued)
